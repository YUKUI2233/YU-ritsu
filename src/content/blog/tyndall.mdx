That'S TRUE

-------------------------------------

**How to make it?**

*First*

Draw the approximate shape of the light, and fill the colour of light you need

Then click "Opacity 不透明度", set it lower

Add a layer mask and use a black soft brush to erase the unwanted parts of the light effect

*second*

To highlight the Tyndall effect, we should make the beam of light.


 Here I provide two ways

      *1*

  "CTRL + 2 + ALT" to selection of highlight areas

  Go to  Filter(滤镜) > Blur(模糊) > Radial Blur(径向模糊)
  
      *2*

  Using a gradient fill and then adjusting the saturation and levels
